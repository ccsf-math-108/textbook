Computational Tools
===================

This text uses the Python 3 programming language, along with a standard set of
numerical and data visualization tools that are used widely in commercial
applications, scientific experiments, and open-source projects.
Python has recruited enthusiasts from many professions that use data to draw
conclusions. By learning the Python language, you will join a
million-person-strong community of software developers and data scientists.

By default, your instructors will have you write code
in Python using the Jupyter Notebook platform configured for this course at
[ccsf.cloudbank.2i2c.cloud](https://ccsf.cloudbank.2i2c.cloud/). 

You will gain access to the site using your CCSF Google account:
* Your Google username is your CCSF email that ends with @mail.ccsf.edu
* Your password can be found in your Student Portal or reset using the Help Desk.

MATH 108 includes an introduction to all of these computational tools.
You will learn to write programs, generate images from data, and work with
real-world data sets that are published online.
